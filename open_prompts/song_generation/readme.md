Lyrics to #1 Chart Topping Hit "Pangolin", by Bono and Larry Mullen jr.
```

Response
```
Intro by Bono:
Now my right hand man, Larry Mullen
Sings, and you know how we do it
With a perfect unisono
You'll need a translation when he speak it
So, let me break it down for you
But you can't break it down for us
Larry,
What did you see there, what did you feel?
Been wanting to ask ya for such a long time.

Pre-Chorus by Larry:
I saw a hairy animal, with a tube like nose
And big sharp points at the end of his toes
Called a Pangolin it's the most treasured animal in all of Africa
For it's fur and for it's meat it's a delicacy
But they will make a fine pelt for the lady in my life.

Bridge:
Like a dying star
It fell from the sky in a blaze of glory
Like the day of judgement
I only read about it in the holy book of books
And I can't help but wonder, will I be ready when it's my time?
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright

Solo by Larry
Solo by Adam
Solo by Larry

And every time that I think about that pangolin
It makes my spirit rise like the night of the eagle
Though I'm out here chasing waterfalls
I'm never gonna find one as sweet as my mother.
```
