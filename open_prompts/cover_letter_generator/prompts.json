            "prompt": "Dear Deloitte graduate recruitment,\n\nI'm writing to apply to join your graduate scheme in Technology Consulting.",
            "response": "I'm a competitive and driven second year Physics graduate from the University of Bristol and have a passion for technology and science that I've been fostering for the last five years.\n\nI've had a number of jobs throughout my degree, from working in a building site to painting hotels as well as helping to organise Bristol's biggest career fairs. These have all helped me to understand what I want from my career, as well as teach me skills that I can apply to my career in technology consulting. I'm a qualified coach with a passion for encouraging people to achieve their potential and to deliver the best results possible.\n\nI understand you're looking for technology consultants with a strong technical background who have skills that can be transferred to real-world challenges. As you can see from my attached CV, I have excellent analytical skills, which I developed through my degree and through my work experience, and I am a forward-thinker with a creative approach to problem solving.\n\nAs part of my university course, I've taken part in technology outreach sessions, allowing me to meet young people from schools, colleges and sixth forms and to promote careers in science, technology, engineering and maths. I've taken these sessions to under-represented groups, such as children with special needs, and I understand that they are a great way to show young people that STEM subjects are accessible to everyone, no matter what their academic background.\n\nIn my spare time, I'm a keen skier and tennis player and I also enjoy playing football. These activities have taught me excellent time management skills and I'm used to balancing different priorities. I know that in technology consulting you have to juggle a range of different projects and responsibilities, all while maintaining a demanding work-life balance.\n\nI am a quick learner and a diligent worker, and I understand that in order to succeed, I have to demonstrate commitment, curiosity and a passion for technology. In the attached reference from my course leader at the University of Bristol, you can see how I always try to do my best and ask questions in order to learn as much as I can. I understand the importance of self-development and I can assure you that I will never stop learning.\n\nI'm keen to join your technology consulting team because I know I would thrive in the challenging and fast-paced environment. I'd love the opportunity to learn from your expert consultants and to work with a team that is working on a diverse range of projects. I've heard great things about Deloitte and would love to find out more. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\nElla Duffy"
