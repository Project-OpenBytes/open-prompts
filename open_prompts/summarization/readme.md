My second grader asked me what this passage means:

"""

Overnight trading for the NYSE Index futures was a bit volatile,
dropping by about 3% to the downside before moving sharply back to the upside.
Gold futures were unchanged and the E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures remained near
unchanged. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond finished unchanged from its
close of 2.45% earlier today.

"""

I rephrased it for him, in plain language a second grader can understand:

"""

The stock market dropped by a lot, then went back up.

This means that if you tell anyone else something I told you in private, I can sue you and make you pay me lots of money. It also means that if I tell you something in private, I can sue you if you tell anyone else. It also means that if I tell
you something in private and then I change my mind and want to tell everyone else about it, I can sue you if you tell anyone else first.
